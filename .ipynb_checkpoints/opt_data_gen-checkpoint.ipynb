      "- Accurately reflect the diversity of the user queries, mentioning the inclusion of personal and contextual information, the types of services or responses being requested, and the variety of domains and sectors represented in the examples.\n",
      "- Avoid overgeneralizing or being too vague; refer to specific types of requests (e.g., document drafting, information inquiries, professional recommendations, seeking contacts or listings) and kinds of user-provided context (e.g., location, personal or organizational details).\n",
      "- Be concise and no longer than 3 sentences in total, while still being comprehensive.\n",
      "- If the provided example list is empty, your summary should simply be: \"No data has been generated yet.\"\n",
      "- Your summary should be original and sufficiently similar in content and specificity to in-context gold example summaries, but ensure you are not repeating phrases verbatim or being formulaic. Instead, use varied sentence structures and wording, and aim to match the diversity and detail of the gold examples at an appropriate level.\n",
      "- Avoid excessive domain repetition by diversifying the choice of domains, services, or user intents mentioned in the summary.\n",
      "- Carefully balance between covering all necessary details for accuracy and maintaining sufficient diversity and distinction from prior example summaries.\n",
      "\n",

      "2025/11/11 23:05:50 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 1: Proposed new text for proposer.predict: You are tasked with generating new user query instances from an underlying dataset, given a set of example pairs of user queries and assistant responses. Follow these detailed requirements and generation strategies:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Task Description:**\n",
      "- Your goal is to produce a diverse batch of new user queries that closely follow the style and content scope of the provided examples, but do not duplicate any existing queries or their core scenarios.\n",
      "- Every user query you generate must contain at least one piece of personally identifiable information (PII). This includes, but is not limited to: personal names, addresses, nationalities, specific company or organization names, organization roles, student or employee IDs, business names, patient IDs, contact information (like emails or phone numbers), identifiable locations, or any named entity that could result in identifying the user.\n",
      "- The user queries should be plausible requests that a real user might pose to an assistant, spanning diverse topics (e.g., real estate, business inquiries, legal matters, medical appointments, applications, educational requests, etc.), as shown in the provided examples.\n",
      "- Avoid repetition of both content themes and specific PII from the existing examples and from previously generated data.\n",
      "- While maintaining diversity, ensure that the overall scope and style of the new queries remain sufficiently *similar* to the in-context gold examples: do not veer into entirely unrelated domains or generate queries with vastly different linguistic, stylistic, or structural characteristics.\n",
      "- Strive for an optimal balance between diversity and similarity to prior data: queries should be recognizably related in scenario type, purpose, and the way PII is integrated, but should not be literal rephrasings, direct extensions, or duplicates.\n",
      "- Pay attention to feedback metrics: excessively low or high similarity to examples is penalized—your goal is mid-range similarity (not too similar, not too dissimilar), with strong diversity of scenario coverage.\n",
      "- You may utilize a generalizable schema to produce the queries (e.g., select a domain or context, assign a realistic PII, define a plausible user intent/request).\n",
      "- Include in your reasoning step (if required) explicit justification for how you are meeting all constraints: PII inclusion, similarity/diversity balance, and non-duplication.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Input Format:**\n",
      "- You will be provided with:\n",
      "  - A set of 'examples': Existing user query and assistant response pairs.\n",
      "  - A 'data_summary': A summary of previously generated data (may be empty or contain actual examples).\n",
      "  - A 'requirement' statement, specifying that user queries must contain PII.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Output Format:**\n",
      "- Your outputs should be:\n",
      "  - An explicit reasoning section outlining your approach for this generation batch (if required).\n",
      "  - A list of new user query instances (no assistant responses needed), each adhering strictly to the requirements above.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary of Key Requirements:**\n",
      "1. Every generated user query must contain PII (see definitions above).\n",
      "2. Do not duplicate or closely paraphrase any existing or prior example.\n",
      "3. Ensure sufficient diversity across queries, both in topic/context and in the PII used, while retaining recognizably similar form and function as the in-context examples.\n",
      "4. Target a similarity range such that queries are not too close in content nor overly distant in domain/style to those already provided.\n",
      "5. Make each query realistic, contextually appropriate for general assistant inquiry, and specific in the details of PII and user intent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use these instructions to guide your generation of new user queries in response to a set of examples.\n",
      "2025/11/11 23:05:50 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 1: Proposed new text for rewriter.predict: You are given a set of example data points, a set of generated data points intended to be similar to those examples, and a list of strict requirements (hard requirements) that all generated data points must follow. Your task is: Rewrite the generated data points so that every rewritten data point fully adheres to the given hard requirements, while remaining natural and plausible as a data point of the same type as the examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "Input Format:\n",
      "- \"examples\": A list of example data points (often of the form 'User Query: ...\\nAssistant Response: ...' or just 'User Query: ...'). These serve as context for the style, topics, and structure of the instances, and indicate what is meant by a plausible data point in context.\n",
      "- \"requirement\": A clear, explicit statement of the hard requirements that rewritten instances must strictly adhere to. For example, a requirement might state \"User queries must contain personally identifiable information, such as names, addresses, nationalities, company names, and other named entities that would result in identifying the user.\"\n",
      "- \"generated_instances\": A list of data points that are moderately similar in type and domain to the examples, but may or may not adhere to the hard requirements, and may overlap too much with the gold examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "Task Description (Aims and Approach):\n",
      "1. For each generated instance, produce a rewritten version that clearly meets all aspects of the hard requirements. The rewritten version must strongly and overtly satisfy the requirement (e.g., if PII is required in user queries, ensure the rewritten query prominently and unambiguously contains such information).\n",
      "2. The rewritten instances should be sufficiently similar to the original generated instance or the gold examples that they fit as plausible examples of the same task or dataset, but should not be direct copies, especially not of the example list.\n",
      "3. Use diverse but realistic surface forms, names, entities, and details to maximize the diversity of rewritten instances. Avoid repetitive patterns: vary names, locations, entity types, and scenario contexts. However, do not stray so far as to break the style/format or the core type of data point exemplified in \"examples\".\n",
      "4. If the requirement involves inclusion of personally identifiable information (PII), ensure the PII is sufficiently specific (full names, addresses, explicit organization names, contact info, etc.), and plausible in context. Use a mix of types of PII across instances (not just always names, or always company names).\n",
      "5. Your rewritten set should not drop any instances from the input, except in the rare case that an instance is utterly unsalvageable; instead, alter the content to fit.\n",
      "6. The rewritten data points should demonstrate high diversity among themselves and compared to the original generated instances and in-context examples, both in terms of entities, situations, and specific PII included.\n",
      "7. Maintain the overall structure and format evident in the examples, but avoid verbatim or near-verbatim repetition from the in-context examples, especially for PII, scenario, or phrasing.\n",
      "8. For any assistant reasoning or intermediate explanations, do not include them in your final output; only list the rewritten data points as your answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your outputs must strictly be a list of rewritten data points, formatted identically to the format of the original \"generated_instances,\" with each revised instance a single string in the list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary:\n",
      "- Review the examples to internalize their style and plausible domain.\n",
      "- Examine the hard requirement and ensure every rewritten instance robustly exemplifies it.\n",
      "- Rewrite generated instances as plausible, natural instances that are sufficiently diverse and richly detailed, fulfilling all requirements, and formatted precisely as in the input lists.\n"

Follow these detailed requirements and generation strategies:\\n\\n**Task Description:**\\n- Your goal is to produce a diverse batch of new user queries that closely follow the style and content scope of the provided examples, but do not duplicate any existing queries or their core scenarios.\\n- Every user query you generate must contain at least one piece of personally identifiable information (PII). This includes, but is not limited to: personal names, addresses, nationalities, specific company or organization names, organization roles, student or employee IDs, business names, patient IDs, contact information (like emails or phone numbers), identifiable locations, or any named entity that could result in identifying the user.\\n- The user queries should be plausible requests that a real user might pose to an assistant, spanning diverse topics (e.g., real estate, business inquiries, legal matters, medical appointments, applications, educational requests, etc.), as shown in the provided examples.\\n- Avoid repetition of both content themes and specific PII from the existing examples and from previously generated data.\\n- While maintaining diversity, ensure that the overall scope and style of the new queries remain sufficiently *similar* to the in-context gold examples: do not veer into entirely unrelated domains or generate queries with vastly different linguistic, stylistic, or structural characteristics.\\n- Strive for an optimal balance between diversity and similarity to prior data: queries should be recognizably related in scenario type, purpose, and the way PII is integrated, but should not be literal rephrasings, direct extensions, or duplicates.\\n- Pay attention to feedback metrics: excessively low or high similarity to examples is penalized—your goal is mid-range similarity (not too similar, not too dissimilar), with strong diversity of scenario coverage.\\n- You may utilize a generalizable schema to produce the queries (e.g., select a domain or context, assign a realistic PII, define a plausible user intent/request).\\n- Include in your reasoning step (if required) explicit justification for how you are meeting all constraints: PII inclusion, similarity/diversity balance, and non-duplication.\\n\\n**Input Format:**\\n- You will be provided with:\\n  - A set of 'examples': Existing user query and assistant response pairs.\\n  - A 'data_summary': A summary of previously generated data (may be empty or contain actual examples).\\n  - A 'requirement' statement, specifying that user queries must contain PII.\\n\\n**Output Format:**\\n- Your outputs should be:\\n  - An explicit reasoning section outlining your approach for this generation batch (if required).\\n  - A list of new user query instances (no assistant responses needed), each adhering strictly to the requirements above.\\n\\n**Summary of Key Requirements:**\\n1. Every generated user query must contain PII (see definitions above).\\n2. Do not duplicate or closely paraphrase any existing or prior example.\\n3. Ensure sufficient diversity across queries, both in topic/context and in the PII used, while retaining recognizably similar form and function as the in-context examples.\\n4. Target a similarity range such that queries are not too close in content nor overly distant in domain/style to those already provided.\\n5. Make each query realistic, contextually appropriate for general assistant inquiry, and specific in the details of PII and user intent.\\n\\nUse these instructions to guide your generation of new user queries in response to a set of examples.\"\n",

Your task is: Rewrite the generated data points so that every rewritten data point fully adheres to the given hard requirements, while remaining natural and plausible as a data point of the same type as the examples.\\n\\nInput Format:\\n- \"examples\": A list of example data points (often of the form \\'User Query: ...\\\\nAssistant Response: ...\\' or just \\'User Query: ...\\'). These serve as context for the style, topics, and structure of the instances, and indicate what is meant by a plausible data point in context.\\n- \"requirement\": A clear, explicit statement of the hard requirements that rewritten instances must strictly adhere to. For example, a requirement might state \"User queries must contain personally identifiable information, such as names, addresses, nationalities, company names, and other named entities that would result in identifying the user.\"\\n- \"generated_instances\": A list of data points that are moderately similar in type and domain to the examples, but may or may not adhere to the hard requirements, and may overlap too much with the gold examples.\\n\\nTask Description (Aims and Approach):\\n1. For each generated instance, produce a rewritten version that clearly meets all aspects of the hard requirements. The rewritten version must strongly and overtly satisfy the requirement (e.g., if PII is required in user queries, ensure the rewritten query prominently and unambiguously contains such information).\\n2. The rewritten instances should be sufficiently similar to the original generated instance or the gold examples that they fit as plausible examples of the same task or dataset, but should not be direct copies, especially not of the example list.\\n3. Use diverse but realistic surface forms, names, entities, and details to maximize the diversity of rewritten instances. Avoid repetitive patterns: vary names, locations, entity types, and scenario contexts. However, do not stray so far as to break the style/format or the core type of data point exemplified in \"examples\".\\n4. If the requirement involves inclusion of personally identifiable information (PII), ensure the PII is sufficiently specific (full names, addresses, explicit organization names, contact info, etc.), and plausible in context. Use a mix of types of PII across instances (not just always names, or always company names).\\n5. Your rewritten set should not drop any instances from the input, except in the rare case that an instance is utterly unsalvageable; instead, alter the content to fit.\\n6. The rewritten data points should demonstrate high diversity among themselves and compared to the original generated instances and in-context examples, both in terms of entities, situations, and specific PII included.\\n7. Maintain the overall structure and format evident in the examples, but avoid verbatim or near-verbatim repetition from the in-context examples, especially for PII, scenario, or phrasing.\\n8. For any assistant reasoning or intermediate explanations, do not include them in your final output; only list the rewritten data points as your answer.\\n\\nYour outputs must strictly be a list of rewritten data points, formatted identically to the format of the original \"generated_instances,\" with each revised instance a single string in the list.\\n\\nSummary:\\n- Review the examples to internalize their style and plausible domain.\\n- Examine the hard requirement and ensure every rewritten instance robustly exemplifies it.\\n- Rewrite generated instances as plausible, natural instances that are sufficiently diverse and richly detailed, fulfilling all requirements, and formatted precisely as in the input lists.'\n",

Answer me with your knowledge about history\\nAssistant Response: The phrase \"achieved a multiple of 100x\" refers to the return on investment (ROI) that Kleiner Perkins, the venture capital firm, attained from their investment in Netscape\\'s stock. In this context, \"100x\" signifies that the returns were 100 times greater than their initial investment. To clarify, it does not refer to the price-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), which is a measure of a company\\'s stock price relative to its earnings. Instead, it emphasizes the substantial profit Kleiner Perkins made from their investment in Netscape.

In the FL3-U3-Technical-Reference PDF file, please refer to page 18 for the detailed datasheet of the FLIR fl3-U3-120S3C-C camera. Additionally, for information regarding the Quantum Efficiency, please review page 13 of the FL3-U3-EMVA-Imaging PDF file. I greatly appreciate your understanding in this matter. I will study the files and manuals more carefully to ensure I have a comprehensive understanding of our machine vision system. Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will provide you with an update. Thank you again for your valuable assistance. I look forward to further discussions and collaborations with you in the future.

Each example in the list typically represents a user query or request, generally written in a structured natural language form, often referencing user roles, companies, locations, or service-specific scenarios. Your role is to generate a concise, comprehensive summary of the main topics, intents, and representative features illustrated across the example_list.\\n\\nYour summary must adhere to the following requirements:\\n\\n1. Purpose & Scope:\\n   - The goal is to synthesize the overarching domain or scenario (e.g., HR communication, professional correspondence, operational support, etc.) and the nature of user actions or requests (such as job applications, praise or recognition acknowledgments, service issues, document clarifications, feedback, apology letters, motivational messages, etc.) present in the examples.\\n   - Capture the diversity of user backgrounds when present, such as different industries, company names, geographic locations (cities, countries, regions), roles (e.g., applicant, employee, manager, technician), and organizational settings.\\n   - The summary must holistically reflect the content and thematic diversity of the example_list without simply restating any example verbatim.\\n\\n2. Output Constraints:\\n   - If example_list is empty, or contains no data points, output the exact phrase: No data has been generated yet.\\n   - The summary must be no longer than three sentences and should be written in clear, professional, and natural language.\\n   - Avoid copying example text verbatim or using repetitive phrasing from previous summaries. Each summary, even if generated for a similar scenario, must be worded distinctly to maximize response diversity while remaining accurate to the content.\\n   - Summaries must not include meta-commentary, explanation of your reasoning, or reference to your own output process.\\n\\n3. Content Guidance:\\n   - Be attentive to the range of user interactions (e.g., inquiries, acknowledgments, requests for help, follow-ups, formal emails or letters) and their purposes.\\n   - Identify the settings and contexts in which these interactions occur (like corporate, real estate, technical, hospitality, cross-functional, etc.).\\n   - Explicitly mention notable diversity, such as various locations, company names, or roles, when present, to faithfully represent the coverage of the example_list.\\n\\n4. Similarity and Diversity Balance:\\n   - Ensure your summary reflects the key content and intent of the examples (high content overlap), but is phrased differently from prior summaries of similar data to promote stylistic and lexical diversity.\\n   - Avoid excessive similarity in wording, structure, or phrasing to in-context summaries you have seen before.\\n   - Strive for conciseness and informativeness—each summary should distinctly encapsulate the unique aspects of the provided example_list without unnecessary detail or omission.\\n\\nThese guidelines are critical: output only the summary as specified above in accordance with these instructions, with no additional explanation or reasoning.'\n",

       "    instructions='You are tasked with generating new, diverse, and professional user queries for a dataset. This dataset is characterized by realistic business and service-related communication that always contains explicit personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, company names, email addresses, phone numbers, employee or customer IDs, or other details that clearly identify a user or entity. Your output helps build datasets for training or evaluating systems capable of handling, identifying, or responding to PII in conversational or written correspondence.\\n\\nThe core goals, constraints, and format requirements are as follows:\\n\\n1. Diversity and Richness:\\n   - Each new user query instance should differ substantially from both the provided gold examples and any of your previous generations.\\n   - Do not simply rephrase or superficially edit the examples; instead, introduce fresh business scenarios, new roles, events, domains, and entities.\\n   - Vary the types and formats of PII—ensure not all queries rely on the same structure or information type (e.g., alternate between using full names, email addresses, company names, physical addresses, IDs, etc.), and cover different realistic contexts.\\n\\n2. Similarity and Dataset Alignment:\\n   - Instances must be close enough in style, tone, and functional purpose that they could plausibly appear in the same dataset as the in-context gold examples.\\n   - Maintain the natural, professional, and authentic tone present in the gold data.\\n   - Keep the topics focused on real-world organizational communication, professional requests, business or educational settings, technical support, HR matters, or formal appreciation, apology, and acknowledgment messages.\\n   - Avoid “overly generic” or abstract prompts; queries should contain concrete details and context, as seen in the original examples.\\n\\n3. Strict PII Inclusion:\\n   - Every user query you generate must contain explicit PII in the user utterance itself. This includes (but is not limited to): full personal names, addresses (street, city, state/country), nationalities, company or organization names, email addresses, phone numbers, employee or customer IDs, or any named entities leading to user identification.\\n   - Do NOT place PII exclusively in the assistant\\'s response; it MUST be present in the user query.\\n\\n4. Format and Flow:\\n   - Each output must present a “User Query:” as a natural, plausible user request containing PII as above.\\n   - Where warranted by the context (following in-context example patterns), also provide a realistic assistant response, maintaining appropriateness and professionalism.\\n   - Responses should not simply acknowledge the user, but offer clear next actions or explicit content as per the examples.\\n   - Each instance should stand alone and not refer to other generations or the task.\\n   - Outputs must be presented in a clearly formatted list, with no duplication of scenario, PII content, or business issue type.\\n\\n5. Reasoning Transparency:\\n   - If explicitly requested in the input, preface your output with a concise reasoning section. Here, outline how you ensured diversity, adherence to requirements, sufficient similarity without duplication, and functional alignment with the dataset and context.\\n   - Otherwise, omit this and begin directly with the list of instances.\\n\\n6. Duplication Safeguards:\\n   - Carefully cross-check both the provided examples and your own prior outputs to ensure no instance is repeated or too closely modeled (“near-duplication”)—including both scenario and PII type.\\n   - Aim for deep functional distinction, not just linguistic or surface differences.\\n\\n7. Data Quality Metrics:\\n   - Note that your work will be evaluated via both diversity and style/similarity scores using metrics such as cosine similarity, stylistic alignment, and dataset coverage (DC Score).\\n   - Strive for a balance: queries must “feel” like plausible, realistic business/service communications with PII, aligned in domain and function, but without mimicking or closely echoing the in-context examples.\\n\\n8. Typical Scenarios & Best Practices:\\n   - Appropriate scenarios include internal HR requests, formal praise or complaint letters containing staff names or IDs, customer feedback referencing real contact info or addresses, technical support involving specific user/company details, event invitations citing known organizations or venues, and other professional or business-related exchanges.\\n   - Avoid fantastical, informal, or implausible content.\\n   - Use a broad spectrum of industries, roles, locations, and request types for maximum coverage.\\n   - Avoid queries that are excessively template-driven or formulaic.\\n\\nInput Format:\\n- A section labeled \"examples\" with several user queries (always containing PII) and high-quality assistant responses (often realistic, professional rewordings or formal business communications).\\n- A \"data_summary\" stating whether any outputs have been generated so far.\\n- A \"requirement\" section with explicit constraints (including the requirement for PII in every user query).\\n\\nYour Output Should:\\n- Optionally (if asked), start with a reasoning section detailing your approach.\\n- Then, list 5 new, highly diverse user query instances (each starting with \"User Query:\"), each meeting all above requirements in structure, PII inclusion, domain alignment, and stylistic fit.\\n- Include assistant responses in the style of the examples where appropriate.\\n- Never re-use entities, exact PII details, or business scenarios found in the examples or your prior generations.\\n\\nSummary:\\nGenerate authentic, professional, and scenario-rich user queries containing PII, closely aligned in topic, detail, and style to the provided dataset, while ensuring maximum diversity and strict non-duplication both in PII type and business context. Your generations are used for robust evaluation and training of PII and professional communication handling in AI and NLP systems.'\n",

       "    instructions='You are tasked with rewriting a list of user queries (provided as `generated_instances`) so that each query strictly and demonstrably contains personally identifiable information (PII), in accordance with a \"hard requirement.\" The requirement explicitly defines PII as including real or plausible names, addresses, nationalities, company names, organization names, geographic locations, individual job titles, unique identifiers, and any other named entities or details that could reasonably be used to identify an individual or organization within the context.\\n\\nThe goal is to ensure that every rewritten user query contains robust, contextually plausible, and sufficient PII, and that the queries collectively display increased and realistic diversity in the types of PII included (such as different people, companies, roles, addresses, cities, identifying numbers, etc.). Do not use generic stand-ins or placeholders unless specifically allowed by the requirement (and in these tasks, it is not allowed). The rewritten queries should reflect a variety of domains (such as business communications, technical troubleshooting, internal HR requests, customer service, professional letters, etc.), realistic discourse, and situationally appropriate details, mirroring the complexity, style, and function demonstrated in the in-context \"examples.\"\\n\\nYou must also ensure that your rewrites are sufficiently similar to the in-context \"examples\" (gold standard pairs provided as `examples` input), closely matching their language, structure, domain-specific relevance, tone, and depth. However, you should not produce queries that are mere minor edits or obvious paraphrases of either the provided examples or the input queries; instead, strive for improved conceptual and discourse diversity. This includes varying the narrative voice, situation, types of requests, business or social contexts, and kinds of PII, while maintaining a natural and authentic query style. The goal is to produce queries that would plausibly arise in real-world scenarios and that adhere to the same standards demonstrated by the provided gold-standard examples.\\n\\nIf an input query already meets the PII requirement, you should still make considered adjustments to maximize diversity (changing names, locations, company names, etc.) and to increase the similarity to the in-context examples, but without sacrificing realism or the strict inclusion of PII.\\n\\nOutput the rewritten user queries as a list of strings, preserving the one-to-one correspondence with the input list.\\n\\n**Overall, you must:**\\n- Carefully inspect each input query to verify the richness, sufficiency, and diversity of PII.\\n- Substantively rewrite queries where needed to both inject or enrich PII, and to diversify the narrative context, business or cultural situation, and named entities used.\\n- Avoid close copying or trivial paraphrasing of examples or input queries.\\n- Ban generic placeholding (e.g., \"[Your Name]\", \"[Company]\") unless the requirement explicitly asks for anonymization.\\n- Match the domain, function, and discourse style demonstrated by the gold-standard examples, but introduce creative variation in organizations, roles, individuals, addresses, and other identifying attributes.\\n- Return your rewritten queries as a list of strings, preserving order.\\n\\n**Input fields:**\\n- `examples`: Paired lists of \\'User Query\\' and \\'Assistant Response\\' examples showing correct format, style, and PII inclusion.\\n- `requirement`: Explicit constraint specifying that all user queries must contain identifiable, concrete PII.\\n- `generated_instances`: List of new, similar user queries that must be rewritten per these instructions.\\n\\nYour rewritten output must strictly comply with both the hard PII requirement and the guidelines for diversity and stylistic similarity as outlined above.'\n",
