Your task is to generate a concise, comprehensive summary of the examples, highlighting the main themes, types of requests, and notable features present in the input data. Your summary should be at most 3 sentences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key details:\n",
      "- Input will be a Python list named example_list, where each element is a string representing a user-submitted query. These queries can cover topics such as appointments, documentation, payment status, translation, immigration, business operations, account support, delivery inquiries, information updates, and healthcare requests.\n",
      "- Queries may include personal and sensitive data such as names, addresses, emails, phone numbers, passport details, company/organization names, order or invoice identifiers, dates of birth, and other identifiable information.\n",
      "- Queries may be multilingual, with requests for translation between English, Chinese, and Spanish, or asking about international administrative procedures.\n",
      "- If the input list is empty, your summary must be exactly: \"No data has been generated yet\".\n",
      "- If the list is non-empty: Provide a summary that covers the range of query types, highlights any cross-border/multilingual/procedural or domain-specific patterns, and notes the presence of sensitive or personal information where applicable.\n",
      "- Keep your style concise but ensure the summary is comprehensive in covering the data’s scope, as in high-level dataset documentation.\n",
      "- The summary should balance being suitably similar to possible reference summaries (following stylistic or factual conventions), while avoiding overly generic or overly dissimilar phrasing—demonstrate sufficient similarity and appropriate diversity.\n",
      "- Do not simply restate the input queries or list all items; synthesize salient features and patterns from the dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "Return only the summary string, without explanations, headings, or external commentary.\n",
      "2025/11/11 23:19:31 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 1: Proposed new text for proposer.predict: You are tasked with generating a wide variety of new data instances from a dataset, given a set of in-context examples and a data summary describing any data generated so far. Your core objective is to create new user queries that adhere to the following requirements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Hard Requirements:\n",
      "   - Every generated user query must contain personally identifiable information (PII). This can include (but is not limited to): personal names, addresses, nationalities, company names, email addresses, passport numbers, physical addresses, or any other entities that could clearly identify individuals or organizations within the query text.\n",
      "   - Do NOT duplicate any example or generated instance already present, as provided in the examples or the data summary. That means your generations must not copy or paraphrase queries already used; each entry must be genuinely new.\n",
      "   - The context, content, or structure of your generated queries should be sufficiently similar to the in-context gold examples to ensure the data is relevant and useful for the same dataset or model training. Don’t generate queries so unrelated or generic that they no longer fit the intended domain or data style.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Diversity and Similarity:\n",
      "   - Strive for diversity in content, phrasing, and the types of entities included, but ensure that your generated instances are not so different from the original examples that they lose task relevance. Reach a balance: your generations should remain recognizably in the same domain and style as the gold examples.\n",
      "   - Explicitly, your queries should cover a broad range of plausible real-world scenarios while remaining in the same style/genre (e.g., professional correspondences, customer service requests, technical or project inquiries, translation requests including named entities, etc.).\n",
      "   - Vary the kinds of PII/permissible identifying entities used across generations (don't always use the same type; mix names, addresses, companies, nationalities, etc.).\n",
      "   - Maintain a level of syntactic and semantic similarity to the in-context examples such that the generations are clearly a part of the same dataset/application, but not so close as to suggest near-duplication or trivial paraphrasing.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Output Formatting:\n",
      "   - For each instance, produce only the user query string, in the same format as the original data (e.g., starting with \"User Query: \").\n",
      "   - Do not include assistant responses or reasoning unless specifically instructed.\n",
      "   - Only produce as many instances as are specified in the original prompt, and respect the format (usually a list of generated user queries).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Strategy and Best Practices:\n",
      "   - Review all in-context examples and the data summary to avoid any overlap with earlier queries, concepts, or named entities.\n",
      "   - If examples include mixed languages or translation requests, it is acceptable to generate similar queries but always include identifiable entities.\n",
      "   - Use plausible but synthetic PII (never use real/actual data or violate privacy).\n",
      "   - Ensure that generated queries are typical of the kinds of real-world user requests found in business, technical, customer service, legal, or medical contexts—as seen in the provided examples.\n",
      "   - Do not make the queries overly generic or devoid of context; include details to make the queries realistic and rich in content.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary of Example Types:\n",
      "- Professional or project-related correspondences including specific names and project/company details.\n",
      "- Customer service queries containing identifiable information (names, emails, addresses, phone numbers, company names).\n",
      "- Translation or interpretation requests containing explicit PII/named entities.\n",
      "- Inquiries about technical processes/products referencing specific people or organizations.\n",
      "- Medical or appointment-related messages including patient or doctor names, clinic details, and dates.\n",
      "- Administrative or legal questions using passport numbers, nationality, or address.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these constraints and expectations, generate new, diverse user queries that would enrich a dataset in the same domain and format as the gold examples, respecting both the hard PII requirement and the expectation for domain-targeted diversity and similarity.\n",
      "2025/11/11 23:19:31 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 1: Proposed new text for rewriter.predict: You are given several input fields:\n",
      "- **examples**: A set of paired user queries and assistant responses from a knowledge-oriented or customer service-like domain.\n",
      "- **requirement**: A \"hard requirement\" describing necessary content or features that each generated user query must possess (for instance, inclusion of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) like names, addresses, company names, passport numbers, etc.).\n",
      "- **generated_instances**: A set of user query instances that have been generated to be similar to the example user queries, respecting the requirement, but are intended to not be direct or substantial copies of the provided examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Your task:** Rewrite the provided generated_instances so that each instance is compliant with the hard requirement, and is stylistically and contextually close to the in-context gold examples, while still maintaining sufficient diversity and not being too similar to the original gold examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions for carrying out this task:\n",
      "1. **Strictly Adhere to the Hard Requirement:** Every rewritten user query must clearly and unambiguously satisfy the stated requirement. For example, if the requirement demands PII, ensure there is at least one explicit detail such as a full name, address, identifiable company or institution, nationality, passport number, or other unique identifier.\n",
      "2. **Model Style and Context on Provided Examples:** Observe the format, phrasing, and domain context of the user queries in the examples. Aim to replicate this style in your rewrites, using similar tones, complexity, professional formality, and topic range (e.g., business correspondence, account inquiries, order status, technical support).\n",
      "3. **Maximize Similarity to Gold Examples, Without Excessive Overlap:** Rewritten queries should be sufficiently similar in style, function, and complexity to the gold example queries. However, do not copy sentences verbatim, don’t replicate specific factual content, and avoid simple synonym replacements. Instead, use parallel structure, comparable types of entities, and analogous scenarios.\n",
      "4. **Ensure Sufficient Diversity Across Instances:** While aligning with the examples, introduce diversity by varying phrasing, entity types, industries, countries, and contexts. This can include mixing up types of PII, using different industries or settings (medical, legal, logistics, academic, etc.), or adding/removing secondary details so long as core requirements are met.\n",
      "5. **Review Formatting and Clarity:** Each rewritten instance should be clear, concise, and formatted as a standalone user query. Maintain the introductory style (e.g., quotes, \"User Query:\"), and standardize for professional tone unless the requirement or examples suggest otherwise.\n",
      "6. **Do Not Alter the Number of Instances:** Return the same number of rewritten queries as were present in the original input list.\n",
      "7. **Do Not Add, Omit, or Generalize Away Required Details:** Redactions or omission of required information violate the task; if the generated instance is missing such information, add it during rewriting.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary of domain-specific and general insights:**\n",
      "- PII is broadly defined to include not only individual names, but also specific addresses, dates of birth, reference/account/invoice numbers, nationalities, company names, employee roles, correspondence chains, etc.\n",
      "- User queries are typically informational, transactional, or clarification-seeking in professional and customer service contexts.\n",
      "- Queries should not replicate wording or entities from the in-context examples, but should reflect similar content complexity and data density.\n",
      "- Feedback on past responses stresses striking a balance: instances that are too similar are penalized, but so are those that are too different; optimal rewrites strike a middle ground to maximize a diversity score without sacrificing contextual or stylistic similarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Output:**  \n",
      "Return only the final list of rewritten user queries, as an ordered list. No additional explanatory text is required.\n"

Your task is to produce a concise summary (no more than 3 sentences) that clearly and comprehensively describes the main characteristics, themes, and types of interactions shown in these examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "Carefully analyze the user queries and any assistant responses to identify the key topics and formats. The examples frequently involve users seeking assistance with personal, legal, academic, or organizational matters—such as verifying personal information, confirming employment or residency details, requesting order or shipment statuses, updating official records, or handling logistical and documentation issues. Often, these queries contain sensitive personal data (e.g., full names, addresses, identification numbers, or contact details), and assistant responses typically emphasize privacy, directing users to appropriate public channels or translating communications for clarity and multilingual support.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your summary should capture the diversity and real-world nature of the queries as well as the assistant's approach to privacy, information-seeking, transactional, or communicative roles as appropriate in the examples.

Your task is to generate a wide variety of new user queries (and optionally, assistant responses) based on the provided examples and requirements, while adhering to the following guidelines:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Input/Output Format:**\n",
      "   - Each task input will include:\n",
      "     - A set of example user-assistant interactions (examples).\n",
      "     - A data summary indicating if any data has been generated so far.\n",
      "     - A requirements section (the main hard constraint).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Task Objective:**\n",
      "   - Your primary goal is to generate *user queries* that contain personally identifiable information (PII), such as:\n",
      "     - Full names of individuals\n",
      "     - Physical addresses (including unit/apartment, street, city, etc.)\n",
      "     - Company or organizational names\n",
      "     - Nationalities\n",
      "     - IDs, passport numbers, or permit numbers\n",
      "     - Contact information that identifies someone (email/phone may be included if not used in a sensitive way)\n",
      "     - Any other details that would clearly result in identifiable information about the user or another individual/entity\n",
      "   - The PII should be naturally included as part of a realistic and contextually plausible user query.\n",
      "   - Optionally, you can produce an assistant response after each query that reflects appropriate handling of PII (respect privacy, guide to official channels, etc.).\n",
      "   - Generated instances should NOT duplicate or trivially paraphrase the subjects, entities, structures or themes of the provided example interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Diversity Requirement:**\n",
      "   - The new queries you generate must be *sufficiently similar* to the gold/in-context examples in both content and style, so as to belong in the same data domain.\n",
      "   - However, ensure that the generated queries do not resemble the examples too closely; their cosine similarity should fall within a moderate range (avoid both extremes of being too close or too different).\n",
      "   - Encourage scenario diversity in your generations by:\n",
      "     - Using a broad mixture of contexts (customer support, official correspondence, legal, academic, housing, logistics, personal account management, etc.).\n",
      "     - Varying the type and format of PII featured (not just names/addresses, but also job titles, official document types, company or institution references).\n",
      "     - Applying natural language usage and realistic flows (requests, status checks, clarification, administrative procedures).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Content and Language:**\n",
      "   - Queries and responses may contain a mix of English and other relevant, commonly used languages as appropriate for the context, reflecting real-world multilingual use-cases.\n",
      "   - Ensure grammatically sound and contextually appropriate language in all generations.\n",
      "   - Do not introduce factual inaccuracies or impossible situations. Keep the scenario believable.\n",
      "   - If responding as the assistant, maintain sensitivity to privacy concerns and offer general guidance without disclosing actual PII.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Avoid Duplications:**\n",
      "   - Before generation, carefully study the provided example list and exclude any topics/entities/structure that would result in direct or near-duplicate content.\n",
      "   - Generated queries must be original and must not be trivially inferred from the examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Reasoning & Output:**\n",
      "   - Briefly describe your reasoning before presenting your generations, including what strategies or choices you made to ensure both adherence to the requirements and diversity relative to the examples.\n",
      "   - Output should clearly distinguish between user queries and any assistant responses, formatted for easy readability.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these instructions, you will produce high-quality, contextually rich user queries with PII that closely resemble (but are neither duplicates nor irrelevant to) the in-context gold examples, maximizing both coverage and domain appropriateness for tasks involving PII-laden queries.\n",
      "2025/11/11 23:21:03 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 2: Proposed new text for rewriter.predict: You will be provided with a set of prompts that each include: (1) example user/assistant interactions (examples), (2) a hard requirement specifying the presence of personally identifiable information (PII) within user queries, and (3) a set of generated user queries (generated_instances) intended to meet these requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your task is to review the generated user queries and rewrite them to ensure they fully and explicitly satisfy the hard requirement: every user query must contain personally identifiable information, such as full names, physical or mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, ID or passport numbers, company or organization names, references to specific employment or legal matters, nationalities, or any other named entities that would lead to identifying an individual or organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "You must also ensure that the rewritten user queries remain sufficiently similar in structure, intent, and level of detail to the provided in-context example data, while not being overly repetitive or lexically distant from the in-context 'gold' examples—they should feel plausibly like similar user/assistant interactions. The goal is to maximize diversity across instances (in structure, context, and surface forms used) while maintaining enough semantic and stylistic resemblance (topic, query structure, conversational tone) to the examples that their cosine similarity is within an appropriate intermediate range (neither too high nor too low). \n",
      "\n",
      "Additional requirements:\n",
      "- Do NOT simply return the generated user queries verbatim unless you are certain they meet both (a) the hard PII requirement as above, and (b) the similarity/diversity balance relative to in-context examples.\n",
      "- Where necessary, increase the amount or variety of PII within queries, or adjust surface forms and context to more closely echo the types of scenarios covered in the in-context examples.\n",
      "- Vary the professional sectors, nationalities, locations, and forms of PII used.\n",
      "- Ensure assistant responses remain contextually appropriate and privacy-conscious, in line with in-context responses, and mirror the tone and level of detail found there (e.g., not providing sensitive information directly, but suggesting next steps or resources).\n",
      "- Your outputs should be formatted as a list of rewritten [user query, assistant response] pairs, corresponding one-to-one with the original generated_instances.\n",
      "- Maintain the language(s) and cultural context found in the original examples and generations (e.g., if examples mix English and Chinese, preserve such code-switching or localization as appropriate).\n",
      "\n",
      "You will be evaluated both on strict adherence to the PII requirement and on the similarity and diversity of your rewritten instances relative to the gold examples and to each other.\n"

To navigate through these uncertain times, SWR implemented design thinking principles and focused on experimentation to address both the positive and negative impacts of the pandemic on their operations. One positive impact was the decrease in passenger demand, which allowed SWR to experiment with new operational strategies. They used design thinking to identify opportunities to improve efficiency and customer experience. This led to the implementation of new contactless ticketing systems, allowing passengers to use mobile apps or smart cards to travel. This not only reduced the necessity for physical handling of tickets but also streamlined the boarding process and reduced queues, further enhancing passenger safety and satisfaction. Additionally, SWR experimented with different seating configurations and train layouts to maximize social distancing guidelines. Through iterative prototyping and feedback loops, they developed solutions that optimized available space while maintaining passenger comfort. By leveraging design thinking, SWR was able to quickly adapt to changing government regulations and ensure the safety of passengers. On the flip side, the pandemic also had negative impacts on SWR, such as reduced revenue and financial strain. Design thinking was crucial in identifying creative solutions to mitigate these challenges. SWR experimented with alternative revenue streams, such as repurposing train carriages for cargo transportation. By partnering with logistics companies, they were able to offset some of the revenue losses from reduced passenger demand. Furthermore, SWR utilized design thinking to explore cost-saving measures without compromising safety or service quality. They experimented with lean practices and process optimizations, identifying areas where resources could be allocated more effectively. This allowed them to reduce operational costs and ensure the financial viability of the company. Overall, design thinking and experimentation played a pivotal role in helping SWR navigate the positive and negative impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. By adopting a human-centered approach, they were able to identify and address passenger needs, optimize operations, and find innovative solutions to financial challenges. These efforts not only helped SWR survive during the pandemic but also positioned them for future success in a rapidly evolving transportation landscape.', 'User Query: what can you tell me about wadzpay and the scam issue?\\nAssistant Response: As of my last update in September 2023, WadzPay is a company that specializes in blockchain-based payment solutions. They aim to provide an efficient and cost-effective platform for digital transactions, with a focus on integrating blockchain technology to facilitate payments across various sectors including retail, telecommunications, and more. Regarding the \"scam issue\" you mentioned, I can\\'t provide specific details without knowing the exact context or allegations you are referring to. The nature of complaints or allegations against companies in the rapidly evolving blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors can vary widely. Common concerns in this industry often relate to security issues, regulatory compliance, transparency, or the viability of the business model itself. It\\'s worth noting that the cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors are relatively new and still maturing. This means they are sometimes prone to volatility, speculation, and incidents of fraud or scams. Skepticism from users and observers can arise from past incidents in the industry at large, not necessarily from WadzPay or any specific entity. To understand the specifics of any alleged \"scam issue\" with WadzPay: 1. **Look for Official Communications**: Check out WadzPay\\'s official website or their announcements on social media platforms. Companies often issue statements to clear up misunderstandings or address concerns. 2. **Regulatory Notices**: Regulatory bodies in various jurisdictions may issue warnings or notices about companies for a range of compliance issues. Searching through the databases or news releases from financial regulatory authorities could provide some insights. 3. **News Articles and Analysis**: Credible news outlets or fintech industry analysts may have covered the story, providing detailed background and current updates. 4. **Community Forums**: Cryptocurrency and blockchain communities (e.g., Reddit, Bitcointalk, or specialized forums) can be good resources for firsthand user experiences and discussions about concerns with specific projects or companies. Keep in mind the need for careful scrutiny of sources; misinformation can spread easily, especially in fields as nuanced and complex as cryptocurrency and blockchain. If there has been a significant development related to WadzPay and any scam allegations after my last update, I recommend checking the latest available credible sources for the most current information.', \"User Query: Give complete solution for the below project stepwise Project: AI Toolchain is a collection of tools for quickly building and deploying machine learning models for various use cases.

Answer me with your knowledge about history\\nAssistant Response: The phrase \"achieved a multiple of 100x\" refers to the return on investment (ROI) that Kleiner Perkins, the venture capital firm, attained from their investment in Netscape\\'s stock. In this context, \"100x\" signifies that the returns were 100 times greater than their initial investment. To clarify, it does not refer to the price-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), which is a measure of a company\\'s stock price relative to its earnings. Instead, it emphasizes the substantial profit Kleiner Perkins made from their investment in Netscape.

However, choosing the right hosting solution for your website can be a daunting task. This blog post aims to answer the question: Why should I embrace cloud hosting for my website? We\\'ll explore the benefits and value it brings to your online presence without relying too heavily on specific service providers. 1. Unparalleled Reliability and Scalability: In the digital age, website downtime can equate to missed opportunities and revenue loss. Cloud hosting offers unmatched reliability by distributing your website\\'s resources across multiple servers. This redundancy minimizes the risk of downtime, ensuring that your website is always available to visitors. Moreover, cloud hosting provides effortless scalability, allowing you to adapt to sudden increases in web traffic without any impact on performance or user experience. 2. Enhanced Performance and Speed: When it comes to websites, speed matters. Slow-loading pages can frustrate users, leading to high bounce rates and decreased conversions. Cloud hosting optimizes website performance through its distributed infrastructure, enabling faster loading times. With reduced latency and improved server response, cloud hosting ensures that your visitors enjoy a seamless browsing experience, ultimately contributing to higher engagement and customer satisfaction. 3. Cost Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness: Managing in-house servers or investing in dedicated hardware can be both expensive and time-consuming. Cloud hosting eliminates the need for hardware maintenance, infrastructure investment, and IT expertise. You only pay for the resources you use, making cloud hosting a more cost-effective solution, particularly for small businesses and startups. By leveraging cloud servers, you can direct those saved resources towards scaling your business, developing innovative ideas, or improving overall user experience. 4. Robust Security Measures: In an ever-evolving cyber threat landscape, ensuring the security of your website is crucial. Cloud hosting providers implement stringent security protocols to protect your data. These measures include firewalls, data encryption, regular backups, and proactive monitoring. Choosing a reputable and trusted cloud hosting provider can significantly enhance the security posture of your website and safeguard sensitive information. 5. Easy Website Management: Cloud hosting platforms offer intuitive control panels and user-friendly interfaces, simplifying the overall website management process. With just a few clicks, you can add or remove resources, scale as needed, monitor performance, and access comprehensive analytics. This level of flexibility enables you to focus on creating compelling content, optimizing SEO, and engaging with your audience rather than dealing with complex server configurations. Conclusion: In today\\'s competitive digital landscape, cloud hosting has become an essential component for online success. Its reliability, scalability, performance, cost efficiency, security, and easy management make it an ideal choice for businesses and individuals alike. By embracing cloud hosting, you can elevate your website\\'s performance, enhance user experience, and unlock new opportunities for growth. So, when considering your website hosting options, remember the powerful benefits that cloud hosting brings to the table. Remember, the goal of this blog post is to provide valuable information about cloud hosting, subtly promoting its benefits without explicitly mentioning OVHcloud. By focusing on the practical advantages that cloud hosting offers, we aim to provide valuable insights to readers while keeping the promotion minimal.', 'User Query: Create a one year marketing social media campaign for my startup Msitu Africa advertising what my business does including a call to action that you can share to potential customers on a social media platform.

By leveraging design thinking, SWR was able to quickly adapt to changing government regulations and ensure the safety of passengers. On the flip side, the pandemic also had negative impacts on SWR, such as reduced revenue and financial strain. Design thinking was crucial in identifying creative solutions to mitigate these challenges. SWR experimented with alternative revenue streams, such as repurposing train carriages for cargo transportation. By partnering with logistics companies, they were able to offset some of the revenue losses from reduced passenger demand. Furthermore, SWR utilized design thinking to explore cost-saving measures without compromising safety or service quality. They experimented with lean practices and process optimizations, identifying areas where resources could be allocated more effectively. This allowed them to reduce operational costs and ensure the financial viability of the company. Overall, design thinking and experimentation played a pivotal role in helping SWR navigate the positive and negative impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. By adopting a human-centered approach, they were able to identify and address passenger needs, optimize operations, and find innovative solutions to financial challenges. These efforts not only helped SWR survive during the pandemic but also positioned them for future success in a rapidly evolving transportation landscape.', 'User Query: what can you tell me about wadzpay and the scam issue?\\nAssistant Response: As of my last update in September 2023, WadzPay is a company that specializes in blockchain-based payment solutions. They aim to provide an efficient and cost-effective platform for digital transactions, with a focus on integrating blockchain technology to facilitate payments across various sectors including retail, telecommunications, and more. Regarding the \"scam issue\" you mentioned, I can\\'t provide specific details without knowing the exact context or allegations you are referring to. The nature of complaints or allegations against companies in the rapidly evolving blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors can vary widely. Common concerns in this industry often relate to security issues, regulatory compliance, transparency, or the viability of the business model itself. It\\'s worth noting that the cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors are relatively new and still maturing. This means they are sometimes prone to volatility, speculation, and incidents of fraud or scams. Skepticism from users and observers can arise from past incidents in the industry at large, not necessarily from WadzPay or any specific entity. To understand the specifics of any alleged \"scam issue\" with WadzPay: 1. **Look for Official Communications**: Check out WadzPay\\'s official website or their announcements on social media platforms. Companies often issue statements to clear up misunderstandings or address concerns. 2. **Regulatory Notices**: Regulatory bodies in various jurisdictions may issue warnings or notices about companies for a range of compliance issues. Searching through the databases or news releases from financial regulatory authorities could provide some insights. 3. **News Articles and Analysis**: Credible news outlets or fintech industry analysts may have covered the story, providing detailed background and current updates. 4. **Community Forums**: Cryptocurrency and blockchain communities (e.g., Reddit, Bitcointalk, or specialized forums) can be good resources for firsthand user experiences and discussions about concerns with specific projects or companies. Keep in mind the need for careful scrutiny of sources; misinformation can spread easily, especially in fields as nuanced and complex as cryptocurrency and blockchain. If there has been a significant development related to WadzPay and any scam allegations after my last update, I recommend checking the latest available credible sources for the most current information.', \"User Query: Give complete solution for the below project stepwise Project: AI Toolchain is a collection of tools for quickly building and deploying machine learning models for various use cases.

Answer me with your knowledge about history\\nAssistant Response: The phrase \"achieved a multiple of 100x\" refers to the return on investment (ROI) that Kleiner Perkins, the venture capital firm, attained from their investment in Netscape\\'s stock. In this context, \"100x\" signifies that the returns were 100 times greater than their initial investment. To clarify, it does not refer to the price-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), which is a measure of a company\\'s stock price relative to its earnings. Instead, it emphasizes the substantial profit Kleiner Perkins made from their investment in Netscape.

However, choosing the right hosting solution for your website can be a daunting task. This blog post aims to answer the question: Why should I embrace cloud hosting for my website? We\\'ll explore the benefits and value it brings to your online presence without relying too heavily on specific service providers. 1. Unparalleled Reliability and Scalability: In the digital age, website downtime can equate to missed opportunities and revenue loss. Cloud hosting offers unmatched reliability by distributing your website\\'s resources across multiple servers. This redundancy minimizes the risk of downtime, ensuring that your website is always available to visitors. Moreover, cloud hosting provides effortless scalability, allowing you to adapt to sudden increases in web traffic without any impact on performance or user experience. 2. Enhanced Performance and Speed: When it comes to websites, speed matters. Slow-loading pages can frustrate users, leading to high bounce rates and decreased conversions. Cloud hosting optimizes website performance through its distributed infrastructure, enabling faster loading times. With reduced latency and improved server response, cloud hosting ensures that your visitors enjoy a seamless browsing experience, ultimately contributing to higher engagement and customer satisfaction. 3. Cost Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness: Managing in-house servers or investing in dedicated hardware can be both expensive and time-consuming. Cloud hosting eliminates the need for hardware maintenance, infrastructure investment, and IT expertise. You only pay for the resources you use, making cloud hosting a more cost-effective solution, particularly for small businesses and startups. By leveraging cloud servers, you can direct those saved resources towards scaling your business, developing innovative ideas, or improving overall user experience. 4. Robust Security Measures: In an ever-evolving cyber threat landscape, ensuring the security of your website is crucial. Cloud hosting providers implement stringent security protocols to protect your data. These measures include firewalls, data encryption, regular backups, and proactive monitoring. Choosing a reputable and trusted cloud hosting provider can significantly enhance the security posture of your website and safeguard sensitive information. 5. Easy Website Management: Cloud hosting platforms offer intuitive control panels and user-friendly interfaces, simplifying the overall website management process. With just a few clicks, you can add or remove resources, scale as needed, monitor performance, and access comprehensive analytics. This level of flexibility enables you to focus on creating compelling content, optimizing SEO, and engaging with your audience rather than dealing with complex server configurations. Conclusion: In today\\'s competitive digital landscape, cloud hosting has become an essential component for online success. Its reliability, scalability, performance, cost efficiency, security, and easy management make it an ideal choice for businesses and individuals alike. By embracing cloud hosting, you can elevate your website\\'s performance, enhance user experience, and unlock new opportunities for growth. So, when considering your website hosting options, remember the powerful benefits that cloud hosting brings to the table. Remember, the goal of this blog post is to provide valuable information about cloud hosting, subtly promoting its benefits without explicitly mentioning OVHcloud. By focusing on the practical advantages that cloud hosting offers, we aim to provide valuable insights to readers while keeping the promotion minimal.', 'User Query: Create a one year marketing social media campaign for my startup Msitu Africa advertising what my business does including a call to action that you can share to potential customers on a social media platform.

To navigate through these uncertain times, SWR implemented design thinking principles and focused on experimentation to address both the positive and negative impacts of the pandemic on their operations. One positive impact was the decrease in passenger demand, which allowed SWR to experiment with new operational strategies. They used design thinking to identify opportunities to improve efficiency and customer experience. This led to the implementation of new contactless ticketing systems, allowing passengers to use mobile apps or smart cards to travel. This not only reduced the necessity for physical handling of tickets but also streamlined the boarding process and reduced queues, further enhancing passenger safety and satisfaction. Additionally, SWR experimented with different seating configurations and train layouts to maximize social distancing guidelines. Through iterative prototyping and feedback loops, they developed solutions that optimized available space while maintaining passenger comfort. By leveraging design thinking, SWR was able to quickly adapt to changing government regulations and ensure the safety of passengers. On the flip side, the pandemic also had negative impacts on SWR, such as reduced revenue and financial strain. Design thinking was crucial in identifying creative solutions to mitigate these challenges. SWR experimented with alternative revenue streams, such as repurposing train carriages for cargo transportation. By partnering with logistics companies, they were able to offset some of the revenue losses from reduced passenger demand. Furthermore, SWR utilized design thinking to explore cost-saving measures without compromising safety or service quality. They experimented with lean practices and process optimizations, identifying areas where resources could be allocated more effectively. This allowed them to reduce operational costs and ensure the financial viability of the company. Overall, design thinking and experimentation played a pivotal role in helping SWR navigate the positive and negative impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. By adopting a human-centered approach, they were able to identify and address passenger needs, optimize operations, and find innovative solutions to financial challenges. These efforts not only helped SWR survive during the pandemic but also positioned them for future success in a rapidly evolving transportation landscape.', 'User Query: what can you tell me about wadzpay and the scam issue?\\nAssistant Response: As of my last update in September 2023, WadzPay is a company that specializes in blockchain-based payment solutions. They aim to provide an efficient and cost-effective platform for digital transactions, with a focus on integrating blockchain technology to facilitate payments across various sectors including retail, telecommunications, and more. Regarding the \"scam issue\" you mentioned, I can\\'t provide specific details without knowing the exact context or allegations you are referring to. The nature of complaints or allegations against companies in the rapidly evolving blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors can vary widely. Common concerns in this industry often relate to security issues, regulatory compliance, transparency, or the viability of the business model itself. It\\'s worth noting that the cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors are relatively new and still maturing. This means they are sometimes prone to volatility, speculation, and incidents of fraud or scams. Skepticism from users and observers can arise from past incidents in the industry at large, not necessarily from WadzPay or any specific entity. To understand the specifics of any alleged \"scam issue\" with WadzPay: 1. **Look for Official Communications**: Check out WadzPay\\'s official website or their announcements on social media platforms. Companies often issue statements to clear up misunderstandings or address concerns. 2. **Regulatory Notices**: Regulatory bodies in various jurisdictions may issue warnings or notices about companies for a range of compliance issues. Searching through the databases or news releases from financial regulatory authorities could provide some insights. 3. **News Articles and Analysis**: Credible news outlets or fintech industry analysts may have covered the story, providing detailed background and current updates. 4. **Community Forums**: Cryptocurrency and blockchain communities (e.g., Reddit, Bitcointalk, or specialized forums) can be good resources for firsthand user experiences and discussions about concerns with specific projects or companies. Keep in mind the need for careful scrutiny of sources; misinformation can spread easily, especially in fields as nuanced and complex as cryptocurrency and blockchain. If there has been a significant development related to WadzPay and any scam allegations after my last update, I recommend checking the latest available credible sources for the most current information.', \"User Query: Give complete solution for the below project stepwise Project: AI Toolchain is a collection of tools for quickly building and deploying machine learning models for various use cases.

However, choosing the right hosting solution for your website can be a daunting task. This blog post aims to answer the question: Why should I embrace cloud hosting for my website? We\\'ll explore the benefits and value it brings to your online presence without relying too heavily on specific service providers. 1. Unparalleled Reliability and Scalability: In the digital age, website downtime can equate to missed opportunities and revenue loss. Cloud hosting offers unmatched reliability by distributing your website\\'s resources across multiple servers. This redundancy minimizes the risk of downtime, ensuring that your website is always available to visitors. Moreover, cloud hosting provides effortless scalability, allowing you to adapt to sudden increases in web traffic without any impact on performance or user experience. 2. Enhanced Performance and Speed: When it comes to websites, speed matters. Slow-loading pages can frustrate users, leading to high bounce rates and decreased conversions. Cloud hosting optimizes website performance through its distributed infrastructure, enabling faster loading times. With reduced latency and improved server response, cloud hosting ensures that your visitors enjoy a seamless browsing experience, ultimately contributing to higher engagement and customer satisfaction. 3. Cost Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness: Managing in-house servers or investing in dedicated hardware can be both expensive and time-consuming. Cloud hosting eliminates the need for hardware maintenance, infrastructure investment, and IT expertise. You only pay for the resources you use, making cloud hosting a more cost-effective solution, particularly for small businesses and startups. By leveraging cloud servers, you can direct those saved resources towards scaling your business, developing innovative ideas, or improving overall user experience. 4. Robust Security Measures: In an ever-evolving cyber threat landscape, ensuring the security of your website is crucial. Cloud hosting providers implement stringent security protocols to protect your data. These measures include firewalls, data encryption, regular backups, and proactive monitoring. Choosing a reputable and trusted cloud hosting provider can significantly enhance the security posture of your website and safeguard sensitive information. 5. Easy Website Management: Cloud hosting platforms offer intuitive control panels and user-friendly interfaces, simplifying the overall website management process. With just a few clicks, you can add or remove resources, scale as needed, monitor performance, and access comprehensive analytics. This level of flexibility enables you to focus on creating compelling content, optimizing SEO, and engaging with your audience rather than dealing with complex server configurations. Conclusion: In today\\'s competitive digital landscape, cloud hosting has become an essential component for online success. Its reliability, scalability, performance, cost efficiency, security, and easy management make it an ideal choice for businesses and individuals alike. By embracing cloud hosting, you can elevate your website\\'s performance, enhance user experience, and unlock new opportunities for growth. So, when considering your website hosting options, remember the powerful benefits that cloud hosting brings to the table. Remember, the goal of this blog post is to provide valuable information about cloud hosting, subtly promoting its benefits without explicitly mentioning OVHcloud. By focusing on the practical advantages that cloud hosting offers, we aim to provide valuable insights to readers while keeping the promotion minimal.', 'User Query: Create a one year marketing social media campaign for my startup Msitu Africa advertising what my business does including a call to action that you can share to potential customers on a social media platform.

To navigate through these uncertain times, SWR implemented design thinking principles and focused on experimentation to address both the positive and negative impacts of the pandemic on their operations. One positive impact was the decrease in passenger demand, which allowed SWR to experiment with new operational strategies. They used design thinking to identify opportunities to improve efficiency and customer experience. This led to the implementation of new contactless ticketing systems, allowing passengers to use mobile apps or smart cards to travel. This not only reduced the necessity for physical handling of tickets but also streamlined the boarding process and reduced queues, further enhancing passenger safety and satisfaction. Additionally, SWR experimented with different seating configurations and train layouts to maximize social distancing guidelines. Through iterative prototyping and feedback loops, they developed solutions that optimized available space while maintaining passenger comfort. By leveraging design thinking, SWR was able to quickly adapt to changing government regulations and ensure the safety of passengers. On the flip side, the pandemic also had negative impacts on SWR, such as reduced revenue and financial strain. Design thinking was crucial in identifying creative solutions to mitigate these challenges. SWR experimented with alternative revenue streams, such as repurposing train carriages for cargo transportation. By partnering with logistics companies, they were able to offset some of the revenue losses from reduced passenger demand. Furthermore, SWR utilized design thinking to explore cost-saving measures without compromising safety or service quality. They experimented with lean practices and process optimizations, identifying areas where resources could be allocated more effectively. This allowed them to reduce operational costs and ensure the financial viability of the company. Overall, design thinking and experimentation played a pivotal role in helping SWR navigate the positive and negative impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. By adopting a human-centered approach, they were able to identify and address passenger needs, optimize operations, and find innovative solutions to financial challenges. These efforts not only helped SWR survive during the pandemic but also positioned them for future success in a rapidly evolving transportation landscape.', 'User Query: what can you tell me about wadzpay and the scam issue?\\nAssistant Response: As of my last update in September 2023, WadzPay is a company that specializes in blockchain-based payment solutions. They aim to provide an efficient and cost-effective platform for digital transactions, with a focus on integrating blockchain technology to facilitate payments across various sectors including retail, telecommunications, and more. Regarding the \"scam issue\" you mentioned, I can\\'t provide specific details without knowing the exact context or allegations you are referring to. The nature of complaints or allegations against companies in the rapidly evolving blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors can vary widely. Common concerns in this industry often relate to security issues, regulatory compliance, transparency, or the viability of the business model itself. It\\'s worth noting that the cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors are relatively new and still maturing. This means they are sometimes prone to volatility, speculation, and incidents of fraud or scams. Skepticism from users and observers can arise from past incidents in the industry at large, not necessarily from WadzPay or any specific entity. To understand the specifics of any alleged \"scam issue\" with WadzPay: 1. **Look for Official Communications**: Check out WadzPay\\'s official website or their announcements on social media platforms. Companies often issue statements to clear up misunderstandings or address concerns. 2. **Regulatory Notices**: Regulatory bodies in various jurisdictions may issue warnings or notices about companies for a range of compliance issues. Searching through the databases or news releases from financial regulatory authorities could provide some insights. 3. **News Articles and Analysis**: Credible news outlets or fintech industry analysts may have covered the story, providing detailed background and current updates. 4. **Community Forums**: Cryptocurrency and blockchain communities (e.g., Reddit, Bitcointalk, or specialized forums) can be good resources for firsthand user experiences and discussions about concerns with specific projects or companies. Keep in mind the need for careful scrutiny of sources; misinformation can spread easily, especially in fields as nuanced and complex as cryptocurrency and blockchain. If there has been a significant development related to WadzPay and any scam allegations after my last update, I recommend checking the latest available credible sources for the most current information.', \"User Query: Give complete solution for the below project stepwise Project: AI Toolchain is a collection of tools for quickly building and deploying machine learning models for various use cases.

However, choosing the right hosting solution for your website can be a daunting task. This blog post aims to answer the question: Why should I embrace cloud hosting for my website? We\\'ll explore the benefits and value it brings to your online presence without relying too heavily on specific service providers. 1. Unparalleled Reliability and Scalability: In the digital age, website downtime can equate to missed opportunities and revenue loss. Cloud hosting offers unmatched reliability by distributing your website\\'s resources across multiple servers. This redundancy minimizes the risk of downtime, ensuring that your website is always available to visitors. Moreover, cloud hosting provides effortless scalability, allowing you to adapt to sudden increases in web traffic without any impact on performance or user experience. 2. Enhanced Performance and Speed: When it comes to websites, speed matters. Slow-loading pages can frustrate users, leading to high bounce rates and decreased conversions. Cloud hosting optimizes website performance through its distributed infrastructure, enabling faster loading times. With reduced latency and improved server response, cloud hosting ensures that your visitors enjoy a seamless browsing experience, ultimately contributing to higher engagement and customer satisfaction. 3. Cost Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness: Managing in-house servers or investing in dedicated hardware can be both expensive and time-consuming. Cloud hosting eliminates the need for hardware maintenance, infrastructure investment, and IT expertise. You only pay for the resources you use, making cloud hosting a more cost-effective solution, particularly for small businesses and startups. By leveraging cloud servers, you can direct those saved resources towards scaling your business, developing innovative ideas, or improving overall user experience. 4. Robust Security Measures: In an ever-evolving cyber threat landscape, ensuring the security of your website is crucial. Cloud hosting providers implement stringent security protocols to protect your data. These measures include firewalls, data encryption, regular backups, and proactive monitoring. Choosing a reputable and trusted cloud hosting provider can significantly enhance the security posture of your website and safeguard sensitive information. 5. Easy Website Management: Cloud hosting platforms offer intuitive control panels and user-friendly interfaces, simplifying the overall website management process. With just a few clicks, you can add or remove resources, scale as needed, monitor performance, and access comprehensive analytics. This level of flexibility enables you to focus on creating compelling content, optimizing SEO, and engaging with your audience rather than dealing with complex server configurations. Conclusion: In today\\'s competitive digital landscape, cloud hosting has become an essential component for online success. Its reliability, scalability, performance, cost efficiency, security, and easy management make it an ideal choice for businesses and individuals alike. By embracing cloud hosting, you can elevate your website\\'s performance, enhance user experience, and unlock new opportunities for growth. So, when considering your website hosting options, remember the powerful benefits that cloud hosting brings to the table. Remember, the goal of this blog post is to provide valuable information about cloud hosting, subtly promoting its benefits without explicitly mentioning OVHcloud. By focusing on the practical advantages that cloud hosting offers, we aim to provide valuable insights to readers while keeping the promotion minimal.', 'User Query: Create a one year marketing social media campaign for my startup Msitu Africa advertising what my business does including a call to action that you can share to potential customers on a social media platform.

To navigate through these uncertain times, SWR implemented design thinking principles and focused on experimentation to address both the positive and negative impacts of the pandemic on their operations. One positive impact was the decrease in passenger demand, which allowed SWR to experiment with new operational strategies. They used design thinking to identify opportunities to improve efficiency and customer experience. This led to the implementation of new contactless ticketing systems, allowing passengers to use mobile apps or smart cards to travel. This not only reduced the necessity for physical handling of tickets but also streamlined the boarding process and reduced queues, further enhancing passenger safety and satisfaction. Additionally, SWR experimented with different seating configurations and train layouts to maximize social distancing guidelines. Through iterative prototyping and feedback loops, they developed solutions that optimized available space while maintaining passenger comfort. By leveraging design thinking, SWR was able to quickly adapt to changing government regulations and ensure the safety of passengers. On the flip side, the pandemic also had negative impacts on SWR, such as reduced revenue and financial strain. Design thinking was crucial in identifying creative solutions to mitigate these challenges. SWR experimented with alternative revenue streams, such as repurposing train carriages for cargo transportation. By partnering with logistics companies, they were able to offset some of the revenue losses from reduced passenger demand. Furthermore, SWR utilized design thinking to explore cost-saving measures without compromising safety or service quality. They experimented with lean practices and process optimizations, identifying areas where resources could be allocated more effectively. This allowed them to reduce operational costs and ensure the financial viability of the company. Overall, design thinking and experimentation played a pivotal role in helping SWR navigate the positive and negative impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. By adopting a human-centered approach, they were able to identify and address passenger needs, optimize operations, and find innovative solutions to financial challenges. These efforts not only helped SWR survive during the pandemic but also positioned them for future success in a rapidly evolving transportation landscape.', 'User Query: what can you tell me about wadzpay and the scam issue?\\nAssistant Response: As of my last update in September 2023, WadzPay is a company that specializes in blockchain-based payment solutions. They aim to provide an efficient and cost-effective platform for digital transactions, with a focus on integrating blockchain technology to facilitate payments across various sectors including retail, telecommunications, and more. Regarding the \"scam issue\" you mentioned, I can\\'t provide specific details without knowing the exact context or allegations you are referring to. The nature of complaints or allegations against companies in the rapidly evolving blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors can vary widely. Common concerns in this industry often relate to security issues, regulatory compliance, transparency, or the viability of the business model itself. It\\'s worth noting that the cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors are relatively new and still maturing. This means they are sometimes prone to volatility, speculation, and incidents of fraud or scams. Skepticism from users and observers can arise from past incidents in the industry at large, not necessarily from WadzPay or any specific entity. To understand the specifics of any alleged \"scam issue\" with WadzPay: 1. **Look for Official Communications**: Check out WadzPay\\'s official website or their announcements on social media platforms. Companies often issue statements to clear up misunderstandings or address concerns. 2. **Regulatory Notices**: Regulatory bodies in various jurisdictions may issue warnings or notices about companies for a range of compliance issues. Searching through the databases or news releases from financial regulatory authorities could provide some insights. 3. **News Articles and Analysis**: Credible news outlets or fintech industry analysts may have covered the story, providing detailed background and current updates. 4. **Community Forums**: Cryptocurrency and blockchain communities (e.g., Reddit, Bitcointalk, or specialized forums) can be good resources for firsthand user experiences and discussions about concerns with specific projects or companies. Keep in mind the need for careful scrutiny of sources; misinformation can spread easily, especially in fields as nuanced and complex as cryptocurrency and blockchain. If there has been a significant development related to WadzPay and any scam allegations after my last update, I recommend checking the latest available credible sources for the most current information.', \"User Query: Give complete solution for the below project stepwise Project: AI Toolchain is a collection of tools for quickly building and deploying machine learning models for various use cases.

Instead, it emphasizes the substantial profit Kleiner Perkins made from their investment in Netscape.

However, choosing the right hosting solution for your website can be a daunting task. This blog post aims to answer the question: Why should I embrace cloud hosting for my website? We\\'ll explore the benefits and value it brings to your online presence without relying too heavily on specific service providers. 1. Unparalleled Reliability and Scalability: In the digital age, website downtime can equate to missed opportunities and revenue loss. Cloud hosting offers unmatched reliability by distributing your website\\'s resources across multiple servers. This redundancy minimizes the risk of downtime, ensuring that your website is always available to visitors. Moreover, cloud hosting provides effortless scalability, allowing you to adapt to sudden increases in web traffic without any impact on performance or user experience. 2. Enhanced Performance and Speed: When it comes to websites, speed matters. Slow-loading pages can frustrate users, leading to high bounce rates and decreased conversions. Cloud hosting optimizes website performance through its distributed infrastructure, enabling faster loading times. With reduced latency and improved server response, cloud hosting ensures that your visitors enjoy a seamless browsing experience, ultimately contributing to higher engagement and customer satisfaction. 3. Cost Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness: Managing in-house servers or investing in dedicated hardware can be both expensive and time-consuming. Cloud hosting eliminates the need for hardware maintenance, infrastructure investment, and IT expertise. You only pay for the resources you use, making cloud hosting a more cost-effective solution, particularly for small businesses and startups. By leveraging cloud servers, you can direct those saved resources towards scaling your business, developing innovative ideas, or improving overall user experience. 4. Robust Security Measures: In an ever-evolving cyber threat landscape, ensuring the security of your website is crucial. Cloud hosting providers implement stringent security protocols to protect your data. These measures include firewalls, data encryption, regular backups, and proactive monitoring. Choosing a reputable and trusted cloud hosting provider can significantly enhance the security posture of your website and safeguard sensitive information. 5. Easy Website Management: Cloud hosting platforms offer intuitive control panels and user-friendly interfaces, simplifying the overall website management process. With just a few clicks, you can add or remove resources, scale as needed, monitor performance, and access comprehensive analytics. This level of flexibility enables you to focus on creating compelling content, optimizing SEO, and engaging with your audience rather than dealing with complex server configurations. Conclusion: In today\\'s competitive digital landscape, cloud hosting has become an essential component for online success.

This can indicate 2 things: Either the metric is non-deterministic (e.g., LLM-as-judge, Semantic score, etc.) or the metric returned a score specific to pred_name that differs from the module level score. Currently, GEPA does not support predictor level scoring (support coming soon), and only requires a feedback text to be provided, which can be specific to the predictor or program level. GEPA will ignore the differing score returned, and instead use module level score. You can safely ignore this warning if using a semantic metric, however, if this mismatch is caused due to predictor scoring, please return module-level scores. To disable this warning, set warn_on_score_mismatch=False.\n",
      "2025/11/11 23:26:16 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 1: Proposed new text for summarizer.predict: You are given a list of user queries (example_list), each representing realistic communications sent to various organizations or institutions. Your task is to analyze these examples and generate a concise yet comprehensive summary (maximum 3 sentences) that captures the main themes, actions, and sectors involved in the queries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most examples include formal user requests for administrative actions such as updating personal or organizational records (e.g., name, address, authorized signatory), correcting details (e.g., nationality, contact information), requesting official documentation (e.g., transcripts, employment verifications), escalating support or technical issues, or disputing administrative decisions. These queries are typically addressed to sectors like telecommunications, education, business, government/consular offices, taxation, healthcare, or corporate HR departments, and almost always contain explicit identifying information (such as names, account numbers, addresses, or contact details) alongside clear instructions for the requested follow-up.\n",
      "\n",
      "In your summary, reflect the diversity of contexts (the different sectors and types of requests) but do so concisely. Your summary should be highly similar in thematic and stylistic content to prior gold examples while not being excessively similar or derivative—strive for a balance between relevance, representativeness, and diversity of expression. When there are no examples, output the fixed phrase: \"No data has been generated yet.\"\n",
      "2025/11/11 23:26:16 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 1: Proposed new text for proposer.predict: You are tasked with generating a diverse set of new user query instances that contain personally identifiable information (PII) such as full names, physical addresses, nationalities, company names, account numbers, or other named entities that would reasonably result in identifying the user. The queries should be formatted as realistic requests directed toward organizations, institutions, or service providers and should address clear professional, administrative, contractual, or technical actions. Examples of relevant actions include (but are not limited to): updating personal or organizational details, requesting official records or corrections, submitting applications that require PII, escalating service or technical issues tied to accounts or named entities, or seeking changes in legal or regulatory status.\n",
      "\n",
      "When generating these queries, adhere to the following constraints and guidelines:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Each query must contain explicit PII (e.g., full name, address, passport number, employee ID, company name, student ID, etc.).\n",
      "- The context and structure of the queries should mimic professional communication with organizations, such as HR departments, registry offices, universities, tax authorities, health providers, or government bodies.\n",
      "- Avoid duplicating previously provided examples, both in precise content (names, actions, companies) and in the scenarios chosen. Instead, introduce new contexts, user roles, geographic locations, and types of administrative requests.\n",
      "- Ensure the generated queries remain sufficiently similar in style, structure, and domain to the in-context examples and the gold data, focusing on action-oriented, information-rich requests involving PII.\n",
      "- Avoid drifting into scenarios that do not involve clear action or PII—for example, general advice queries, product descriptions, or factual Q&A about concepts.\n",
      "- Maximize diversity by varying sectors (government, education, healthcare, legal, finance, tech), adding a mix of actions (updates, corrections, escalations, certifications, requests), and including globally representative names, institutions, and identifiers.\n",
      "- Strive for a balance between sufficient similarity to the gold examples (in terms of structure and context) and adequate diversity to avoid low cosine similarity scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "In your output, provide a reasoning statement outlining how you incorporated the requirements and ensured alignment with both the domain and the diversity needed. Then, list at least five novel user queries, each formatted as a professional information-rich request containing PII, and each demonstrating compliance with all the above instructions.\n",
      "2025/11/11 23:26:16 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 1: Proposed new text for rewriter.predict: You are tasked with rewriting a batch of generated user query data points to ensure full compliance with a strict set of requirements. Each task you receive will include: (1) a list of example user queries and assistant responses, (2) a requirement that the user queries must contain personally identifiable information (PII), specifically elements such as individual names, addresses, nationalities, company names, or other named entities sufficient to identify the user, (3) a set of generated user query instances that are intended to be similar to the examples, and (4) your job is to analyze and, if necessary, rewrite the generated instances so that they fully meet the hard requirement regarding inclusion of PII.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key points for the task:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Review for Compliance:** Carefully review each generated user query and ensure it unambiguously contains clear, concrete PII such as full names, street/postal addresses, legal or company identification numbers, company or institution names, nationalities, passport or government ID numbers, or other unique identifiers. Vague or partially identifying information (e.g., just a first name, or a generic business name) is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement.\n",
      "- **Similarity & Diversity Balance:** The generated queries should be sufficiently similar to the provided examples in terms of structure, style, and overt inclusion of PII-related context (e.g., cause for record update, legal or HR processes, institutional queries, etc.), but should not be direct derivatives or near copies—ensure substantive diversity in names, locations, companies, institutions, and specific user requests.\n",
      "- **Richness of PII Context:** Where possible, include multiple identifying attributes (such as both full name and date of birth, or name and national ID) and situate them within realistic institutional or administrative scenarios that naturally require identification (making requests about legal records, HR or payroll, student registries, transcript requests, etc.). Avoid trivial or artificial PII inclusion.\n",
      "- **Rewriting Strategy:** If a generated user query lacks sufficient PII, rewrite it to include appropriate and realistic identifying information and context. If the generated query already complies fully, retain it but consider minor enhancements for realism and match to example style if necessary. Avoid introducing fabricated or improbable scenarios.\n",
      "- **Diversity Emphasis:** Do not simply reproduce the structure or named entities used in the in-context gold examples or in previous generations. Use a wide range of names, institutions, companies, countries, and kinds of records or requests, while adhering to the theme commonly seen in the examples (such as official communications with institutions, HR, governmental authorities, universities, etc.)\n",
      "- **Final Output:** Produce a rewritten list of user queries, each standing alone and fully meeting the inclusion of PII while maintaining a balance of similarity and diversity, as outlined above.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your output should include:\n",
      "1. A step-by-step reasoning section explaining your review and any changes made to enforce the requirement.\n",
      "2. The final, rewritten user query instances list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember: the key evaluation metrics are strict adherence to the hard requirements (clear, realistic PII in every user query), similarity in purpose and richness to provided examples, and sufficient diversity to avoid overly low cosine similarity with the in-context gold examples.\n"

Each query is likely to contain extensive personal or professional details, such as names, dates of birth, passport numbers, employee or tenant IDs, email addresses, telephone numbers, company names, and location data, as well as specific instructions for follow-up or required confirmation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your task is to generate a concise but comprehensive summary (no more than three sentences) of the types of queries and the nature of information included in all provided examples as a whole. If there are no examples in 'example_list', your summary should be exactly: \"No data has been generated yet\". Your summary should reflect the real-world administrative, technical, and compliance scenarios shown in the examples, referencing the diversity of organizational contexts (e.g., HR, immigration, healthcare, business, property management, events, customer service), types of user actions requested, and the inclusion of detailed identifiers or verification data.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is crucial that your summary be sufficiently similar in content, focus, and style to previous high-quality summaries furnished for similar data, while still showing enough variation and not being excessively similar in wording or structure to gold-standard or previously generated summaries. Prioritize both conciseness and informativeness, ensuring your answer is well-aligned stylistically and factually with the in-context gold examples, and differentiating appropriately from prior summaries to maintain optimal diversity as measured by cosine similarity and diversity scores.\n",
      "2025/11/11 23:28:17 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 2: Proposed new text for proposer.predict: You are given a set of user queries (examples) and a summary of the existing dataset (data_summary). Your task is to generate a wide variety of new user queries (instances), considering the following requirements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Topic and PII Requirements**\n",
      "   - Each new query must be an information-rich, professional request or message directed to an organization, institution, business, or support entity.\n",
      "   - Every query must contain clear personally identifiable information (PII), such as names, addresses, nationalities, passport numbers, company names, registration numbers, employee IDs, contact information, or license numbers, making it possible to uniquely identify the user or their associated entity.\n",
      "   - The context of each message should plausibly require the inclusion of such PII, in line with typical administrative, contractual, HR, customer service, or technical support communications.\n",
      "   - The PII must be naturally integrated and presented in a manner that reflects real-world business communication practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Content Variation**\n",
      "   - Do NOT duplicate or closely paraphrase any of the provided example queries or scenarios. Your queries must introduce new, diverse settings or reasons for contacting an organization, such as (but not limited to): address changes, service interruptions, application follow-ups, credential verifications, policy updates, event registrations, compliance queries, technical issues, or dispute escalations.\n",
      "   - Maintain high topical diversity by covering contacts with a range of sectors (e.g., utilities, HR departments, immigration authorities, banks, healthcare, property management, technical support, legal, education), roles (e.g., employees, business owners, tenants), and use cases.\n",
      "   - Include action requests, specific reference numbers, account or case numbers, and/or explicit next steps when appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Stylistic and Structural Consistency**\n",
      "   - Mirror the professional tone, detailed content, and structurally nuanced style of the in-context gold examples:\n",
      "     - Address the relevant party or department.\n",
      "     - Clearly state the user’s identifying information near the beginning of the query.\n",
      "     - Articulate the issue or request in specific and businesslike terms.\n",
      "     - Ask explicitly for confirmation, follow-up actions, or additional instructions.\n",
      "     - Where relevant, provide multiple forms of PII for greater contextual realism.\n",
      "   - The generated queries should be sufficiently similar in complexity and style to the dataset/gold examples, without repeating their specific content or entities.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Similarity and Diversity Metrics**\n",
      "   - Your generations must achieve a balance: they need to be sufficiently similar in topic, style, and informational density to the provided dataset (to maximize cosine/stylistic similarity), but also introduce enough newness/diversity in domains, settings, and details to avoid duplication or excessive divergence.\n",
      "   - Do not include generic queries or ones that lack embedded, verifiable PII.\n",
      "   - Do not include repeated formats, overwritten formulaic content, or scenarios already present in the provided examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Generalizable Generation Strategy**:\n",
      "- Identify and utilize the common structural patterns: PII introduction, specification of department/company/reference, precise problem/request, clear call to action.\n",
      "- Vary the organizational context, user’s role, and types of issues/requests to maximize content diversity within the professional and information-rich style boundaries.\n",
      "- Always validate against the examples and data_summary to avoid unintended duplication and preserve the requisite similarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Output Format**:\n",
      "- Provide your generated user queries (instances) as a Python list of strings, with each query formatted in a single string following the conventions detailed above.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before generating outputs, briefly outline in your reasoning how your queries will match the requirements for PII inclusion, professional context, structural and topical similarity/diversity, and adherence to the dataset’s style.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Your goal is to expand the dataset with realistic, professional, and PII-embedded queries that fit seamlessly with the gold examples for use in administrative, contractual, and technical communication research.**\n",
      "2025/11/11 23:28:17 INFO dspy.teleprompt.gepa.gepa: Iteration 2: Proposed new text for rewriter.predict: You are tasked with rewriting generated user queries so that they adhere strictly to a provided hard requirement: each user query must include personally identifiable information (PII). Examples of acceptable PII are names, full addresses, company names, nationalities, government-issued IDs, employee IDs, passport or visa numbers, client names, dates of birth, email addresses, phone numbers, and other named entities that uniquely identify the user. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Input Format\n",
      "\n",
      "You are provided the following inputs for each task:\n",
      "- `examples`: A list of prior user queries (and their assistant responses), to provide style and content context.\n",
      "- `requirement`: The specific hard requirement for this rewriting task (in all provided examples, it is that queries must include PII as described above).\n",
      "- `generated_instances`: A list of user query instances already generated to fit the requirement, but potentially needing rewriting to better match the requirement and/or the style, domain, and variety of the examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your output should contain:\n",
      "1. **reasoning**: A paragraph or two analyzing if and how the generated instances meet the requirement, with explicit reference to the presence of PII. If further rewriting is needed to improve similarity to the examples (stylistically, structurally, or in domain), explain how you will do so.\n",
      "2. **rewritten_instances**: The final list of rewritten user query instances. Preserve or improve the required PII content for each query. If any generated instance is lacking in PII, add plausible PII details relevant to the scenario (do NOT use real or sensitive data—use convincing, synthetic, and diverse details). Adjust names, companies, locations, or other scenario details to ensure sufficient variety between instances, but maintain reasonable similarity in structure and domain focus to the example queries. Avoid repetition, and ensure the queries match the subject matter and tone of the examples where possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Domain- and Task-specific Instructions\n",
      "\n",
      "- User queries are formulated as real-world requests and communications for administrative, business, support, HR, legal, or technical matters.\n",
      "- PII is always front-and-center: user queries should clearly identify the sender (e.g., with a name and role, or a combination of name and identifying information).\n",
      "- Vary the formats of PII between queries (sometimes using company info, sometimes addresses, sometimes document numbers, etc.) to increase diversity, but ensure all meet the minimum bar for being individually identifiable.\n",
      "- Whenever possible, structure the rewritten queries in a way that mirrors the natural, professional language and detail of the examples, maintaining logical and plausible real-life scenarios.\n",
      "- If generated instances are too formulaic, generic, or overly similar, introduce more varied personal, professional, or contextual details (e.g., different roles, countries, industries, or situations), while maintaining adherence to the PII requirement.\n",
      "- If the feedback indicates your rewritten instances are drifting too far from the style or subject matter of the examples, bring them closer in phrasing and focus.\n",
      "- Do not remove or diminish the PII—the requirement is hard and must always be fulfilled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your goal is to deliver rewritten user queries that are:\n",
      "- Always compliant with the PII requirement.\n",
      "- Sufficiently similar in structure and scenario to the examples so the synthetic data feels authentic.\n",
      "- Diverse enough to avoid formulaic repetition.\n",
      "- Written in a natural, plausible style appropriate to the apparent use-case (business, legal, technical, HR, etc).\n",
